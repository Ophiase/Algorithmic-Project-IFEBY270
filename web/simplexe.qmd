## Introduction

In linear optimization, consider a problem in canonical form: \

$\max\{c^T x \,|\, Ax \leq b, x \geq 0\}$

where:\
- $x$ is the vector of variables to be determined\
- $c$ is the vector of coefficients of the objective function\
- $A$ is the matrix of coefficients of the constraints

Any problem in canonical form can be reformulated into a problem of the form:\

$\max\{c_{0} + c^T x \,|\, Ax + x' = b, x \geq 0\, x' \geq 0\}$\

This form is known as the standard form.

The Simplex algorithm is a method to move from one basic solution to another while seeking to improve the objective function.\
When an optimal basic solution is reached, i.e. one that maximizes the objective function, the algorithm stops.\

In the standard form below, we assume $b \geq 0\ $. The constant $c_{0}$ is introduced for technical reasons.\
In this case, $(x,x'â€‹) = (0,b)$ constitutes a basic solution of the problem, and we also refer to the variables $x'$ as basic and the variables $x$ as non-basic.

title: Nash Equilibrium
---

In game theory we consider two rational agents $x$ and $y$ that both want to maximize their score. \
In discrete cases, $x$ has $m$ possible actions, $y$ has n possible actions. 

If $x$ and $y$ play simultaneously, we can considers the matrices $A$ and $B$ of dimension $(m,n)$. \
$A_{i,j}$ and $B_{i, j}$ represents respectivily the score of $x$ and $y$ when $x$ plays his $i$-th action and $y$ his $j$-th action.

## Code

To find the nash equilibrium, create a NashEquilibrium object, and solve it.

```python
solution_x, solution_y = NashEquilibrium(A, B).solve()
```
